# MG-leveltron
A first attempt to make a level editor in this case for the generic platform engine, later to be broadened to include background and lighting previews.

In fixing this, I created a lib-entry that will enable ANY asset to be live-edited from another window, changing the game instantly.
That's a nice bonus :)
